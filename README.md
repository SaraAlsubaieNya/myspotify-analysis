# Spotify Listening Data Analysis

This is a small personal side project where I analyzed my own Spotify listening data using Python. The goal was to explore my music habits and practice data analysis using real-life data.

## What I Did

- Parsed my Spotify streaming history from the official data export
- Identified top artists and tracks based on listening time
- Visualized listening patterns by:
  - Day of the week
  - Hour of the day
  - Monthly trends

## Tools Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
